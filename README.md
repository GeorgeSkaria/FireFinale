## Introduction
FareFinale is an innovative app designed to revolutionize the way consumers interact with local shops, while simultaneously reducing food waste. By providing a platform for consumers to discover and purchase discounted food items close to expiry, FareFinale aims to bridge the gap between consumers seeking affordable options and local shops looking to minimize food waste.

## Problem Statement
In the current food distribution landscape, significant amounts of perfectly edible food reach their expiry dates and are discarded, contributing to economic loss and environmental strain. Simultaneously, consumers are often unaware of opportunities to purchase discounted perishables. FareFinale addresses these challenges by connecting consumers with local shops offering discounted foods close to expiry.

## Implementation
FareFinale is developed using Flutter, ensuring a cross-platform user experience. The app features an intuitive and user-friendly interface catering to both consumers and shop owners. Key implementation aspects include shop and food listings, location-based services, sorting and filtering options, search functionality, shop owner verification, and a view-only mode for offline purchases.
